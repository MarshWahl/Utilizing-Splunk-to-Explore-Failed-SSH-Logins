# Utilizing-Splunk-to-Explore-Failed-SSH-Logins

In this project, I will be emulating working as a security analyst working at the hypothetical e-commerce store Buttercup Games. I've been tasked with identifying whether there are any possible security issues with the mail server. To do so, I must explore any failed SSH logins for the root account. I will be uploading a preset data file to the Splunk Cloud that contains log and event information from Buttercup Games' mail servers and web accounts. This includes information like access and authentication logs, email logs, and more.

Because I have been tasked with exploring any failed SSH logins for the root account on the mail server, I will need to narrow the search for events specifically from the mail server.
To do this, Under "SELECTED FIELDS", click host and click mailsv.
This adds a new term to the search bar: index=main host=mailsv. The search results have narrowed from 109,864 total events to 9,829 events that are specifically generated by the mail server.

To complete my task, I will need to narrow my search further. Entering "index=main host=mailsv fail* root" will accomplish narrowing those results.
This expands the previous search and searches for the keyword "fail*". The wildcard (*) tells Splunk to expand the search term to find other terms that contain the word fail such as failure, failed, etc. Lastly, the keyword "root" searches for any event that contains the term root. This narrows the results to 364 events.

The results here show numerous failed login attempts, each at 01:39:51.000 AM on several different days. This type of data, with numerous simultaneous failed login attempts outside of business hours, provides evidence of potential brute force attacks and would require further investigation.
